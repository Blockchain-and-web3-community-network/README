# Blockchain & Web3 Community Network

Blockchain and Web3 Community Network (BWCN) is a pan-African nonprofit initiative founded in 2022 with a mission to drive education, innovation, and inclusion through blockchain and Web3 technologies. Operating independently, BWCN is committed to empowering individuals and communities across the continent—especially youth, developers, small businesses, and underserved populations—by providing accessible education and practical tools for participating in the decentralized digital economy.

Through community-led workshops, hands-on learning programs, hackathons, and collaborative projects, BWCN fosters grassroots understanding of blockchain fundamentals, decentralized finance (DeFi), digital identity, and emerging Web3 tools. Its core focus is to demystify complex technologies and ensure that Africans are not just users, but active builders and contributors to the future of the internet.
